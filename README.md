# Simple e-book store API

>Just sticking this here for future reference, it's not really for
public consumption though (it's a rough, unfinished prototype).

A basic API for uploading (admin), purchasing and downloading e-books,
originally made for an e-commerce assignment.

## Missing elements

- Email verification + password reset functionality (via registered email + unique url).
- Fuzzy search for books (correct typos, spelling mistakes etc).
- Categories, etc.
- Enforcing SSL.
- A secure audit log about purchase requests, activations and downloads.
- Many checks you'd make for duplicates etc. in database.
- Usage limits (based on number of requests) and enhanced security.
- Pretty code and comments.

> And many more features that would be necessary for a production-ready system.
